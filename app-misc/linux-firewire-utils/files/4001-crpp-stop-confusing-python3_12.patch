-Copyright 2010 Stefan Richter <stefanr@s5r6.in-berlin.de>
-You may freely use, modify, and/or redistribute this program.
-
-Reads Configuration ROM data from stdin and writes a human-readable
-annotated representation to stdout.  The data may be
-  - binary data, i.e. a big endian or little endian quadlet array,
-  - a firewire-ohci debug log,
-  - read results from the tool firecontrol.
-
-Usage examples:
-
-  - Read a configuration ROM as seen in sysfs:
-    (plug device in, find out which fw* it became)
-    crpp < /sys/bus/firewire/devices/fw1/config_rom
-
-  - Read a debug log from when the drivers attempt to probe the device:
-    echo 1 > /sys/module/firewire_ohci/parameters/debug
-    (plug device in, wait a few seconds)
-    dmesg | crpp
-    echo 0 > /sys/module/firewire_ohci/parameters/debug
-
-  - Read the configuration ROM by means of firecontrol.  The example
-    assumes that the device has the node ID ffc0 and that it is
-    attached to the first of all installed FireWire controllers:
-    { for i in {4,5,6,7}{0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,a,b,c,d,e,f}{0,4,8,c};
-      do echo "r . 0 0xfffff0000$i 4";
-      done } | firecontrol | crpp
-
-If you want company IDs being translated to names, you need a file
-called oui.db in /usr/share/misc/ or in the current working directory.
-This file can be obtained from linux-2.6.20 or older kernel soures in
-linux/drivers/ieee1394/ or can be freshly generated by
-    wget -O - http://standards-oui.ieee.org/oui/oui.txt |
-    grep -E '(base 16).*\w+.*$' |
-    sed -e 's/^\s*//' -e 's/\s*(base 16)\s*/ /' > oui.db
-which will download ~3 MB data and result in a ~0.6 MB large oui.db.

-History:
-2010-02-16: initial release
-2010-02-18: small fixes; added protocol entries, OUI lookup, CRC checks
-2010-04-25: added firecontrol input
-2010-07-19: added vendor-defined specifier/version IDs
-2012-04-23: added IIDC2 v1.0.0 protocol entries
-2012-06-12: updated dmesg reader to log format of kernel 3.4
-2015-01-31: updated comment on oui.db: let sed squash leading whitespace
